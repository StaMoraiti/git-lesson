# Notes form the Git course

here are the material form the git [course](https://srse-git-github-zero2hero.netlify.app/)

I have learnt how to:
1) _Create_ a repository : `Init repo` and _clone_ it locally
2) _Stage_, _Commit_, _Push_ fmot the **local** repository to the **origin**
3) How to make changes online and _Pull_ the changes down

**Important note**: Git works with **Markdown** file
